            Event:
            @name: Name of the event.
            @message: Optional message included with the event.

            Emitted by a worker when certain conditions arise, such as beginning
            or ending work.

            The possible values for the 'name' argument are:

            1 = BEGIN
            Emitted when the worker "accepts" a dispatched message and begins
            "working".
            
            2 = END
            Emitted when the worker finishes "working".

            3 = WORKING
            Emitted when the worker wishes to continue to announce it is
            working.

            4 = CONNECTING
            Emitted when the worker starts connecting to bus

            5 = CONNECTED
            Emitted when the worker is connected to bus
