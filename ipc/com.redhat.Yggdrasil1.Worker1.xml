        <!-- RemoteContent:

             fetched from a remote location before dispatch.

            Event:
            @name: Name of the event.
            @message_id: The id associated with the worker message.
            @response_to: Unique ID of the message this message is in reply to.
            @data: Key-value pairs of optional data provided with the event.

            Emitted by a worker when certain conditions arise, such as beginning
            or ending work.

            The possible values for the 'name' argument are:

            1 = BEGIN
            Emitted when the worker "accepts" a dispatched message and begins
            "working".
            
            2 = END
            Emitted when the worker finishes "working".

            3 = WORKING
            Emitted when the worker wishes to continue to announce it is
            working.

            4 = STARTED
            Emitted when the worker is started, and it is ready
            to handle received messages. The message_id and response_id are
            empty.

            5 = STOPPED
            Emitted when the worker is stopped, and it is not able
            to handle received messages anymore. The message_id and
            response_id are also empty.
